hc-ansible-deployment is end-to-end HC deployment playbook which is using both gluster-ansible role and ovirt-ansible-hosted-engine-setup role.
1. There is one inventory file which is gluster_inventory.yml/gluster_inventory_vdo.yml has gluster related configurations
2. The json file he_gluster_vars.json has Hosted-Engine related configurations for gluster.

For new HC deployment both file need to be modified with accurate values like host,device,pvs,vgs,lvs,fqdn,passwords etc

How to run:
 > cd hc-ansible-deployment

 With VDO:
 > ansible-playbook -i gluster_inventory_vdo.yml hc_deployment.yml --extra-vars='@he_gluster_vars.json'

 Without VDO:
 > ansible-playbook -i gluster_inventory.yml hc_deployment.yml --extra-vars='@he_gluster_vars.json'

For gluster deployment clean up:
 > ansible-playbook -i gluster_inventory_vdo.yml/gluster_inventory.yml tasks/gluster_cleanup.yml

Note: Replace appropriate host name with host1,host2 and host3 in inventory file and json file.
